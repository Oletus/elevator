gameutils.js
============

## A Head Start on JavaScript Game Development

Gameutils.js is a collection of helpers aimed at handling the tedious tasks of JavaScript game development.
It is not a framework, but rather a library of simple utilities that can be used independently of each other.

It is for people who like to work with code close to the platform level, but aims to make this as simple as possible.

It is especially well suited for game jams and similar events, with a focus on flexibility that enables the exploration
of new ideas.

It targets browsers that support modern APIs, and has been tested on Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer 11.
